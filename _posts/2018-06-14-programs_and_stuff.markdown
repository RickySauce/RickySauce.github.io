let's get down to the neety' greety'. Why I learning the programs? Very simple, we're all robots if you think about it. I wake up and I eat my coffee, I sit down, I eat some more coffee. At the end of the day you think to yourself, where has all my coffee gone. Then you start REALLY thinkin' to yourself, "hey, I'm a normal guy; I'm a swell guy; I'm a cool kind of guy; I'm a groovy guy". So I figured if I learned to code: I could stop eating my coffee and start drinkin' it, like a true thespian. 
 
  That's right... Thespians. You ever stand in front of a crowd of 32 1/2 roaring fans as you absolutely slay, Act I, Scene III, of Julius Cesar? Didn't think so. Now think about it; what if you programmed your boys in the crowd to shut the hemoglobin up for about 10 seconds. What if in those glorious 10 segundos you let that latin rip like a beyblade and a solitary tear falls from your profs' eyebizz'. Now you're stylin' like Mitchel Goosen sans your cuz' Wiley. The best part about it you don't even need rollerblades or a fly Hawaiian shirt to get the job done. It's just you and your slick macbook tearin' the game apart. Straight' cruisin' down the freeway like an absolute villain. 
	
	I think about the glory to be had. I think to myself, "I will have my glory day in the hot sun". Now all I have to do is set my_life = glory. Create an absolute monster of a reader called glory. create a Class called  "SUN" and just rain all types of chaos from the skies above.
	
Thank You,

End
