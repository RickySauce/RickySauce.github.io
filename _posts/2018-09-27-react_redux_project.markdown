WHELP, This one was a doozy. Now I've been uncomfortable going into some of these projects in the past, but using the word uncomfortable for this project would be an extreme understatement. 

I used the same structure and theme I've used for my past projects: Beer. Actually my jQuery, Sinatra and Redux projects have all been called Beer-Review. Once again the idea behind it, is to create and interactive society through review posts and beer ratings. A user can choose from an index of beers, write a review, see that beer's overall rating and/or change his or her review. 

I don't feel that the course really prepared us for the overwhelming undertaking that is this project. I found a plethora of spelling errors throughout the lessons in the Redux section, which instantly screams to me that there was just a lack of care and effort put in to those labs and lectures. The course flip flops between syntax use in their code-alongs and solutions which further adds to the confusion and frustration. While I understand it's important for us to know that React is flexible in this regard, it would have been much more helpful if the course were more explicit in helping us understand the different syntax use. I feel like the way the course taught and wrote React compared to the online resources was a world's difference. 

That being said. Through the last anxiety ridden week of my life, I perservered. I feel that by the end of every one of these projects my skills with whatever framework we're coding in or with improve vastly. Coming into it, I was very uncomfortable with reducers, combined reducers, and state in general. Now, I feel like I have a strong grasp of how global state works and how it affects my components.
