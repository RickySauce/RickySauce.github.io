For my JQUERY project, I recycled an old idea I used for my Sinatra project. My original Sinatra project was titled 'Beer-Review and my JQUERY app adopted the same name. I think it goes with out say, that this application was far more advanced and robust than that of my Sinatra app. Mainly due in part to the increased efficiency of rails, and the power of JS, but also due to my improved programming skills. 

The App serves as an interactive forum in which users rate and post their experiences with particular beers. Breweries will have a list of beers and through beer reviews will also garner reviews and ratings themselves. Through posting, Users can share valuable experiences and information about a particular beer, but also read reviews and check ratings of a particular beer they have not tried, but are interested in . 

This particular project probably took me if not the longest, second longest amount of time to complete. I think alot of that has to do with my uncomfortability with JavaScript. I feel like the Ruby portion of this course was handled way more efficiently than the JavaScript sections. For the most part I think I taught myself more JavaScript while working on this project, than the course did. 

My life is good, real good. 
I wake up every morning, at 5 a.m. and make some soup.
It's the best.
