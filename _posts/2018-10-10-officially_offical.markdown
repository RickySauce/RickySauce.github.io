Not gonna lie, the only reason I'm writting this, is because it's the last thing that stands in my way of "graduating". 

The React project, was a doozy. To say I crawled my way through it would be an understatement. When I first started the project I could confidently say that I confidently knew nothing. Through an anxiety fueled rage I managed to scrap together the knowledge I needed to not only complete the project, but competently work with the framework to maintain and update my application. 

The course itself has been a whirlwind of emotion, but I'm happy I'm finally done. I look forward to what the future holds, getting a job and finally leaving my dungeon of a room. 

At the end of the day we all want our glory day in the hot sun. Unfortunately, sometimes, the eagle eggs give us no eagle powers, they give us no nutrience. It is important to remember that although the eagle eggs were a lie Steven, a lie; You don't need eagle eggs to program, just a computer and parts of your brain. 

The End. 

P.S.

To all my haters, whattup'
