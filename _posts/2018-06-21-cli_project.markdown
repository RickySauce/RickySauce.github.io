Ever think life's going your way? Well I haven't, so that's why I wasnt too pissed off when everything went to cynthia  while doing my freakin' CLI project. 

I designed an app called 'Beer-List'. It's supposed to scrape all of it's data from BeerAdvocate.com

it derives most of it's data from the page that splits it's beers into different substyles based on parent style and region. From there I go into each and every substyle sort the beers by ratings and then populate an array with the top 20 ratings that have atleast 100 reviews. 

unforunately most of the information I needed wasn't seperated neatly into different tr's so I had to MacGyver my way through the fiery depths of BeerAdvocate hell, and snaggedy doodle the information I needed. To make matters worse each sub-style ratings page wasn't uniform some of them had hidden information that would pop at the end of the page that would skew my data and throw particular sub-style scrapes into endless loops.

That being said. I conquered. 

likea' true thespian .
