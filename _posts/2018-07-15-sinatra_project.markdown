I hate that the hardest parts of these projects are never logic related and always terminal related. It took me 2 days to not only setup the thing but than work out which files weren't cooperating with one another. I'm still not exactly sure why or how I ended up getting it to work, which leaves me even more worrisome. 

My sinatra project is a spinoff of my CLI project, which ended up working out in my favor. I recycled a large portion of my scraper class from the CLI project and used that to seed my SINATRA project with a plethora of objects to help me work out all the kinks.

My project is called Beer-Review and it seeks to emulate the forum and review portion of beer advocate. I purposefully left out the rating attribute from my beer, brewery and review tables so the information can be dynamic based on reviews that are being added and removed from my project. The site is navigatable without logging in, but does offer increased functionality if one decides to signup/login. A user can write reviews, affecting the score of a beer and its brewery. In addition can leave informative written content about the beer theyre reviewing. A User's homepage will show all of that particular users beers, breweries and related reviews.

end.
